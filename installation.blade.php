## Requirements {#requirements}

1. PHP 7.2.5 or higher
2. Laravel 7.0 or higher

Visit the [composer.json file on Github](https://github.com/livewire/livewire/blob/master/composer.json) for the complete list of package requirements.

## Install The Package {#install-package}

@component('components.code', ['lang' => 'shell'])
composer require livewire/livewire
@endcomponent

## Include The Assets {#include-js}
Add the following Blade directives in the `head` tag, and before the end `body` tag in your template.

@component('components.code')
@verbatim
<html>
<head>
    ...
    @livewireStyles
</head>
<body>
    ...
    @livewireScripts
</body>
</html>
@endverbatim
@endcomponent

You can alternatively use the tag syntax.

@component('components.code')
@verbatim
<livewire:styles />
...
<livewire:scripts />
@endverbatim
@endcomponent

That's it! That's all you need to start using Livewire. Everything else on this page is optional.

## Publishing The Config File {#publishing-config}

Livewire aims for "zero-configuration" out-of-the-box, but some users require more configuration options.

You can publish Livewire's config file with the following artisan command:

@component('components.code', ['lang' => 'shell'])
@verbatim
php artisan livewire:publish --config
@endverbatim
@endcomponent

## Publishing Frontend Assets {#publish-assets}

If you prefer the JavaScript assets to be served by your web server not through Laravel, use the `livewire:publish` command:

@component('components.code', ['lang' => 'shell'])
@verbatim
php artisan livewire:publish --assets
@endverbatim
@endcomponent

To keep the assets up-to-date and avoid issues in future updates, we **highly recommend** adding the command to the `post-autoload-dump` scripts in your `composer.json` file:

@component('components.code', ['lang' => 'json'])
@verbatim
{
    "scripts": {
        "post-autoload-dump": [
            "Illuminate\\Foundation\\ComposerScripts::postAutoloadDump",
            "@php artisan package:discover --ansi",
            "@php artisan vendor:publish --force --tag=livewire:assets --ansi"
        ]
    }
}
@endverbatim
@endcomponent

## Configuring The Asset Base URL {#configuring-the-asset-base-url}

By default, Livewire serves its JavaScript portion (`livewire.js`) from the following route in your app: `/livewire/livewire.js`.

The actual script tag that gets generated defaults to:<br> `<script src="/livewire/livewire.js"></script>`

There are two scenarios that will cause this default behavior to break:

1. You publish the Livewire assets and are now serving them from a sub-folder like "assets".

2. Your app is hosted on a non-root path on your domain. For example: `https://your-laravel-app.com/application`. In this case, the actual assets will be served from `/application/livewire/livewire.js`, but the generated script tag, will be trying to fetch `/livewire/livewire.js`.

To solve either of these issues, you can configure the "asset_url" in `config/livewire.php` to customize what's prepended to the `src=""` attribute.

For example, after publishing Livewire's config file, here are the settings that would fix the above two issues:

1. `'asset_url' => '/assets'`
2. `'asset_url' => '/application'`

## Serving Livewire from CDN

By default, Livewire tries to communicate with the backend using the `asset_url`, if your assets are served from CDN this won't work because then Livewire will send all the requests to the CDN url.
To make it works in that setup you should configure the `app_url` which can be found in Livewire config file (if not, you can add this value manually). In most cases, it should have the same value as Laravels `app.url`.
